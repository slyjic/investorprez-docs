## Block Styling Validation Guide

### ðŸ§ª Testing the Block Styling Fixes

**Quick Validation Process**:

1. **Create Test Presentation**:
   - Add different block types: Bar Chart, Hero Section, Quote Box, Timeline
   - Customize Global Styles (colors and typography)
   - Save the presentation

2. **Publish & Compare**:
   - Publish the presentation
   - Open published URL in new tab
   - Compare side-by-side with editor view

3. **What to Check**:
   - âœ… Chart components show gradients and proper colors
   - âœ… Hero sections have background gradients
   - âœ… Quote boxes maintain styling and colors
   - âœ… Timeline components render correctly
   - âœ… Typography follows Global Styles settings
   - âœ… CSS variables resolve (not showing fallback values)

**Debug Information**:
- Check browser console in published presentation for CSS extraction logs
- Look for "ðŸŽ¨ Enhanced CSS Summary" in backend logs during publishing
- Verify CSS includes "Block Components CSS" section

**Environment Testing**:
- Test in local development (localhost:5174)
- Test in production environment
- Ensure identical appearance in both
